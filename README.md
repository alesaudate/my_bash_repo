# My BASH repo

This repository contains some BASH functions that eases my life a lot. 

It contains utilities that:

- Allow me to easily copy / paste contents from my terminal
- Allow me to open a file using Google Chrome
- Easily find and replace a string in the files contained in the current directory tree
- Allow me to execute gradle from any of the project's folders, and monitor its execution 
- Runs gradle tests and, if any one of them fails, automatically open it up on Chrome
- Allow me to run docker compose from the project's root folder
- Monitor Jenkins's job executions
- And much more. 

Also, it clones another repository of mine called [Docker recipes](https://github.com/alesaudate/docker-recipes). Once it does so, it installs the bash files contained there, allowing me to run Kafka, MySQL and AWS CLI (so far) from anywhere in the terminal, with nothing but a simple command.
